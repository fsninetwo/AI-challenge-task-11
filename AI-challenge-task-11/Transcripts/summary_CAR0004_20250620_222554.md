# Summary

The patient, a healthy 25-year-old engineering student and part-time postman, presents with sharp chest pain lasting a few seconds and occurring over the past three days, primarily worsened by coughing or lying down and relieved by leaning forward. He denies other symptoms like shortness of breath, palpitations, or dizziness but is concerned about a heart attack due to a recent family historyâ€”his father died of a heart attack two weeks ago. The patient had a recent flu but no ongoing viral symptoms and no significant medical history or medication use besides occasional Tylenol. The doctor plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate the cause of the pain and reassures the patient while further investigations are underway.
